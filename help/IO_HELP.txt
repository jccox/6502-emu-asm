/** 
 * @param value The byte to set the control reg to.
 * @remarks Here is what the bits do to the control reg.
 * Bit 0 - Turn on to force buffer to output to last used port.
 * Note that this cancels all control features after this.
 * Bit 1 - Turn on default forced output (Output characters at a time)
 * Bit 2 - Line buffering enabled (Active low).
 * Bit 3 - Determine whether port is being defined
 * Bit 4 - Determine whether defined port is input(0) or output(1).
 This is only useful
 * for port 0, which assigns files to ports.
 * Bits 5-7 - Select which port to use.
